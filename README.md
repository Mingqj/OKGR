## About

This is the official of [OKGR](https://github.com/Mingqj/OKGR/). (OKGR: Occluded Keypoint Generation and Refinement for 3D Object Detection). This code is mainly based on [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet), some codes are from [PMPNet](https://github.com/diviswen/PMP-Net).

Supplemental material and code for 'OKGR: Occluded Keypoint Generation and Refinement for 3D Object Detection'.
The supplemental material can be downloaded from [baiduwp](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18wt2LT4dgXg8pa0zYded-w) [mk22].

## Install
NOTE: Please re-install pcdet v0.5 by running `python setup.py develop` even if you have already installed previous version.

a. Install the dependent libraries as follows: 

Install the SparseConv library, we use the implementation from [Spconv](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv).

Install the dependent python libraries: 

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

b. Install this pcdet library and its dependent libraries by running the following command:
```shell
python setup.py develop
```

c. Install the PMPNet library and build pyTorch extensions:
```shell
cd ./pcdet/models/backbones_3d/Chamfer3D/
python setup.py install
```

## Data Preparation
Please follow the instructions in [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet).

## Training and Testing
You could optionally add extra command line parameters `--batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE}`, `${NUM_GPUS}` to specify your preferred parameters.

* Train with multiple GPUs:
```shell
cd tools
bash scripts/dist_train.sh ${NUM_GPUS} --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/pv_rcnn_pp.yaml
```

* Train with a single GPU:
```shell
python train.py --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/pv_rcnn_pp.yaml
```

* Test with multiple GPUs:
```shell
bash scripts/dist_test.sh ${NUM_GPUS} --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/pv_rcnn_pp.yaml --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE} --ckpt ${CKPT}
```

* Test with a single GPU:
```shell
python test.py --cfg_file cfgs/kitti_models/pv_rcnn_pp.yaml --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE} --ckpt ${CKPT}
```
